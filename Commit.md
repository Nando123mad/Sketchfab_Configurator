# Git Commit Message Guide

There are a few things you can do to improve your Git commit messages right off the bat: 

* Avoid unnecessary capitalization 
* Double check your spelling
* Don't end commit message summaries with punctuation

## Writing the Commit Message

The conventional commits structure involves starting your commit message with a specified commit type. Commit types include:

Feat-- feature

Fix-- bug fixes

Docs-- changes to the documentation like README

Style-- style or formatting change 

Perf -- improves code performance

Test-- test a feature

Using the conventional commit method makes it easy for project contributors to filter and search for specific commits, as shown in the example below:

**Summary:**

Docs: Fixes typo on in-from-the-depths.md

**Description:**

Closes ticket #54321

---

One way to ensure your messages comply with the standard is to apply the formula: "If applied, my commit will..." You can apply this to the example:

"If applied, my commit will (INSERT COMMIT MESSAGE TEXT)"

**Summary:**

*"If applied, my commit will..."*

Add new building image to image gallery

**Description:**

*"If applied, my commit will..."*

Modify menu.yml and keif-gallery.md related to ticket #12345

....Ask yourself, If applied what will your commit do? Start your commit message with the answer.
